## Building Chatbots in Python: ##

When done well, interacting with a computer through human language is incredibly powerful and also quite fun. Messaging and Voice-Controlled devices are the next big platforms, and conversational computing has a big role to play in creating engaging augmented and virtual reality experiences.

These mini-programs will get you started on the path towards building such applications!

* __EchoBot__ just responds by replying with the same message it receives.

* __Chitchat__ program can answer simple questions such as "What's your name?" and "What's today's weather?"

* __ELIZA__ bot is the way the program *appears* to understand what you told it, by occasionally including phrases uttered by the user in its responses. It is also responding to statements with a question and responding to questions with answers. To make responses grammatically coherent, you'll want to transform the extracted phrases from first to second person and vice versa. In English, conjugating verbs is easy, and simply swapping "I" and 'you', "my" and "your" works in most cases.
